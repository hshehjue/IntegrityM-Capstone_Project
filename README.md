### 1. Executive Summary
* **Project Goal:**
  - Develop classification machine learning models which can effectively identify healthcare frauds, waste, and abuse of the information on patients
* **Success Criteria:**
  - The predictive model can be replicated in other places without losing much accuracy
  - The model can predict fraudulent patterns with high F1, AUC, ROC scores
* **ProjectPlan:**
● Understand the business problem and goal with clients
● Collect datasets, review documents
● Wrangle with datasets and clean datasets
● Label fraud patterns within the data frame
● Data balancing (undersampling)
● Data partitioning (train, test)
● Data partitioning (train, validation)
● Apply machine learning algorithm to the data
● Measure model performance on a test dataset
● Visualize the results
